# OOP
> **Object Oriented Programing** is a method of programming wherein everything is an object. Objects are composed of **attributes** (data) and **methods** (functions). Objects have an *identity*, which means its attributes' values are distinct from another object with the same attributes.

> OOP is a way of organizing code, by creating reusable chunks of code that can be easily tested, documented, and reused. OOP is reliant on *mutable objects* and *shared state*. The patterns in OOP focus on how objects interact, and what data is contained where.

## Cheat Sheet
### Vanilla JS
```js
// Constructor function (create a class)
var Classname = function(param1, param2) {
  // Create attributes
  this.param1 = param1
  this.param2 = param2
};

// Create methods (attributes that are also functions)
Classname.prototype.methodName = function() {
// code here
};

// Instantiating a new object from the class
var objectName = new Classname()
```
### ES6
```js

// code here
```
